# MIUI Back Gesture Hook

An LSPosed module for researching Xiaomi MIUI/HyperOS back gestures.

The APK integrates with SystemUI and the system back pipeline. It also carries
an arm64-v8a LSPosed Native Hook for the MiuiHome process family spawned by
`hyos_spawner`. Until LSPosed exposes hook-page lifecycle support, the APK
native entry protects its exact inline and PLT/GOT hook pages from Xiaomi's
`MADV_DONTNEED` cleanup before enabling Android 17 business hooks.

Optional integrations (off by default):

- Circle to Search from the gesture handle;
- Google App full-screen Live Translate, with the platform screen-capture consent
  flow unchanged.

Android 16 uses the SystemUI gesture path. Android 17 keeps launcher-side
ownership in the LSPosed native entry and fails closed if its page guard or
validated native profile cannot be established.

## Compatibility

| Platform | Required components | Launcher support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android 16 | LSPosed | SystemUI gesture path |
| Android 17 / HyperOS 4+ | Internal LSPosed with HYOS-spawner support | `4371` static profile; validated newer builds use the runtime resolver |

The native entry is arm64-v8a only. Unsupported or ambiguous layouts fail closed.
LSPosed's enabled/scope state and HYOS injection own spawner compatibility; the
entry validates the exact executable and launcher process identity but does not
pin a `hyos_spawner` Build ID across OTAs. Launcher ELF profiles and business
hook fingerprints remain fail-closed.

## Build

Build the LSPosed release APK:

Linux/macOS:

```shell
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
```

Windows:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleRelease
```

Outputs:

```text
app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

For iterative native development, use the guarded LSPosed deployment script.
It requires Python 3.10 or newer, builds the debug APK by default, installs the
complete APK through Package Manager, verifies the API-102 SystemUI hot reload,
and rolls only the exact
root `hyos_spawner` so the new native APK inode becomes active without a phone
reboot:

```text
python miui-home-hyos-native/safe_lsposed_native_deploy.py --action deploy --serial <adb-serial>
```

Pass `--skip-build` to deploy the existing debug APK, or `--apk <path>` to deploy
an explicitly selected complete APK. The script refuses to run while a retired
standalone owner remains mapped. It never extracts or pushes the APK's native
library separately and never writes Android system properties. The
upgrade requests PackageManager rollback with retained app data and also keeps
a verified copy of the previously installed complete APK as a fallback.

The APK contains `lib/arm64-v8a/libmiui_home_hyos_lsp.so` and declares it in
`META-INF/xposed/native_init.list`. This branch has no standalone native-module
package or activation path.

## Scope and runtime

The static LSPosed scope is:

```text
com.android.systemui
com.miui.home
com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox
system
```

The Google App scope is used only when Live Translate is enabled. On Android 17
and newer, MiuiHome remains listed for compatibility, but it registers no Java
launcher hooks; launcher work is owned by the LSPosed native entry.

API 102 hot reload is enabled with `autoHotReload=true`. The settings screen can
refresh the authenticated SystemUI/native runtime status and resolved launcher profile.
